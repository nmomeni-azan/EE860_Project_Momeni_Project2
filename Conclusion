Overall, based on past research in using the Abalone dataset its evident that this dataset is desirable in performing prediction models for various features, such as sex or age of the mollusk. Based on this study, the Logistic Regression (LR) model exhibited the highest AUC and a high accuracy of 55.2%.  Despite GBC having the highest accuracy, other metrics such as recall, precision, and Cohen’s Kappa statistic show that this model’s behaviour is most effective in prediction the sex of the abalone. Other libraries that can be used to perform similar tasks are Tensorflow/Keras, PyTorch and scikit-learn. All three are machine learning models that are widely used for classification, regression, clustering and many more and can easily be applied to predictive model developments similar to the one conducted in this paper.
