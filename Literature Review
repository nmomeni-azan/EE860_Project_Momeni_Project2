A paper published in 2022 provides a review of using the Abalone dataset to predict the age of the mollusk from the attributes of the dataset. A number of methods are tested such as backpropagation feed-forward neural network (BPFFNN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gauss Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It was found that of the 6 algorithms explored the BPFFNN model provided the highest accuracy of 86.28% and KNN provided the lowest at 86.28%. In this study the categorical feature, sex, was converted into a numerical feature to predict the age of the abalone.

Study performed in 2016 provides an evaluation of neural networks for multiclass classification. The abalone dataset is used to evaluate a multilayer perceptron using 12 parameters. The dataset is used to predict the age of the mollusk and the data was normalized in the range [0,1]. They concluded that accuracy is not the only parameter that should be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of a model. With that being said when the number of layers increased when running the model training, the accuracy as well as the F1 score, and sensitivity increased as well. The overall accuracy was approximately 93% for this evaluation.

A study done in 2021 by Hshan breaks down the multiclass classification problem into multiple binary class problems for predicting the sex of the abalones by the measurement of their physical features. The models used in this evaluation are Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). After running 3 classifications: Infant vs. Not Infant, Female vs. Not Female, and Male vs. Not Male, SVMs were found to be the best models for all classifications but Female vs. Not Female – where QDA was the chosen model. The highest accuracy and F1 score for each classification and model type is as follows: 
-	Infant vs. Not Infant – SVM accuracy 79.93%, F1 Score 0.8577
-	Female vs. Not Female – QDA accuracy 68.05%, F1 score 0.3296
-	Male vs. Not Male – SVM accuracy 63.33%, F1 scored 0.7747
