Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates statistical models so that a computer can effectively perform a specific task through pattern recognition, without explicit instructions. A branch of machine learning is known as Supervised Learning â€“ where a function is created upon training a dataset that contains labels. The Abalone dataset is designed to predict the age of the mollusk from physical measurements. The measurements collected include sex, length, diameter and height, for example. This dataset was trained as a classification model with the sex of the abalone being the target value; in this case the sex class has 3 labels: male, female and infant. Many different models were trained, and a comparison of the best models was conducted on Google Colaboratory using the Pycaret library. It was found that Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forrest Classifier (RF) and Ridge Classifier were the top 3 models to perform. Where LR has the highest overall parameters and RF having the highest F1 score of 0.5470. This paper outlines the comparative analysis of the performances of several models that results in LR being the overall best model due to having the highest accuracy and AUC.
