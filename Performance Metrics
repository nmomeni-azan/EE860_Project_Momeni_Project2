The three-performance metrics that are best used for model comparisons in multiclass classification are accuracy, the confusion matrix and the area under the curve (AUC). Accuracy is best used as a metric when the classes of the target variable are roughly balanced. In this case there is roughly an even distribution of male, female and infant classifications within the variable. The Confusion Matrix is also desirable because of its ability to provide a breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications within the class and shows the errors the model makes. Finally, the AUC is extended as a metric for multiclass classification models. The curve provides a measure of the performance across different classes regarding sensitivity and specificity. With all of that being said, the performance metric that is best used to compare models for this classification is AUC because of its ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. Due to this it also provides a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. In general, although AUC is an excellent indicator of a modelâ€™s behaviour, there must be a holistic analysis of all the parameters of the model in order to determine which one has the best performance.
